      "0 & Temperature Rise Scenarios &  global, scenarios, report, temperature & Models for precipitation and temperature variability however are associated with more uncertainties. Although a decrease in precipitation is being predicted, projected changes in precipitation should be viewed with some caution. The trends analysis implies that total rainy days with 0.1 mm or more of rainfall are decreasing while total yearly days wth 10 mm or more of rain is increasing. This may be interpreted as a decrease in the total amount of precipitation but an increasing trend for convective type rainfall or heavy rainfall. While the uncertainties still prevail, the trends identified from data observations are in line with regional scenarios [255] with regards to both decrease in mean annual precipitation and increase in extreme weather events (increase in the intensity of daily precipitation events) for the Mediterranean region. The IPCC report notes that there will be a higher incidence of drought and heat waves in summer. In this context, while this report will focus on the more certain increase in temperature, as also verified by locally generated scenarios, other impacts associated with the decrease in precipitation and increase in extreme events will be addressed based on regional scenarios. & Global climate change is one of the greatest threats to the world community, leading to adverse social, economic and environmental effects. The continuing increase in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGS) has had a perturbing effect on the earth's radiation balance, which has resulted in the rise of the annual mean surface temperature around the globe. In its Third and Fourth Assessment Reports (2001, 2007), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) presented new and solid evidence that in the last 50 years global warming has, by and large, been the result of human activities and the impact of those activities will continue to be the main cause of climate change in the centuries to come. According to all IPCC emission scenarios, projections show a rise in global surface temperatures. The expected increase in global surface temperature ranges from 1.4°C to 5.8 °C in the 1990 - 2100 period. Predictions indicate that the negative effects of climate change will be felt most severely by poor and least developed countries, of which Lesotho is one. These countries have limited capacity to adapt to the impacts of the emerging climate patterns. & Models for precipitation and temperature variability however are associated with more uncertainties. Although a decrease in precipitation is being predicted, projected changes in precipitation should be viewed with some caution. The trends analysis implies that total rainy days with 0.1 mm or more of rainfall are decreasing while total yearly days with 10 mm or more of rain is increasing. This may be interpreted as a decrease in the total amount of precipitation but an increasing trend for convective type rainfall or heavy rainfall. While the uncertainties still prevail, the trends identified from data observations are in line with regional scenarios (found in the IPCC FAR) with regards to both decrease in mean annual precipitation and increase in extreme weather events (increase in the intensity of daily precipitation events) for the Mediterranean region. The IPCC report notes that there will be a higher incidence of drought and heat waves in summer. In this context, while this report will focus on the more certain increase in temperature, as also verified by locally generated scenarios, other impacts associated with the decrease in precipitation and increase in extreme events will be addressed based on regional scenarios. \\\\\n",
      "1 & Land & Forests &  land, forest, biomass, carbon & Of the LULUCF sector carbon pools included in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, Panama includes pools of above-ground and below-ground biomass, dead organic matter (dead wood and litter), and mineral soils for Land Converted to Forest Land, Land Converted to Cropland, Land Converted to Grassland, and Land Converted to Settlements. Changes in aboveground and belowground biomass carbon stocks are only estimated for Forest Land Remaining Forest Land, Grassland Land Remaining Grassland, and Land Converted to Wetlands, excluding organic soils, since it is assumed for the whole country that the soils are mineral. & South Africa uses a combination of Tier 1, and Tier 2 methods for estimating emissions for the Land category. Annual carbon stock changes in biomass were estimated using the process-based (gain-loss) approach where gains are attributed to growth and losses are due to decay, harvesting, burning, disease, etc. For the land remaining in the same land-use category annual increases in biomass carbon stocks were estimated using Equation 2.9 of the IPCC 2006 Guidelines, where the mean annual biomass growth was estimated using the Tier 1 approach of Equation 2.10 in the IPCC 2006 Guidelines with country specific data. For plantations the Tier 2 approach of this equation was applied. The annual decrease in carbon stocks due to biomass losses were estimated from Equations 2.11 to 2.14 of the IPCC 2006 Guidelines. A Tier 2 approach was implemented for the estimation of carbon biomass stock change in Forest land for both land remaining land and land converted to forest land, while for all the other land classes a Tier 1 for land remaining land and a Tier 2 for land converted to other land (IPCC 2006 Equations 2.15 and 2.16) were applied. The dead organic matter pool only includes litter estimates due to a lack of dead wood data, and it is assumed that all litter pool carbon losses occur entirely in the year of transition (Tier 1). Carbon stock changes in litter were estimated with the stock-difference method (Tier 1), according to Equation 2.23 of the IPCC 2006 Guidelines. Changes in mineral soil carbon stocks for both land remaining land and land converted to a new land use were estimated with a Tier 1 approach from the formulation B of Equation 2.25 (IPCC, 2006 Guidelines, volume 4, p. 2.34). A summary of the methods used are provided in Table 5.3. & The reporting scope of the 2014 China Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry Greenhouse Gas Inventory includes the greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sinks of six land use types including forest land, agricultural land, grassland, wetland, construction land and other land. For each land use and land use change type, the carbon stock changes of the five major carbon pools, namely aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, litter, dead wood and soil organic carbon, were estimated separately according to the actual situation. The level 3 model method was used for the change of soil organic carbon storage in agricultural land, and the “production method” was used for the assessment of forest product carbon storage change. Carbon stock changes are assessed using the Tier 2 method in the IPCC Forestry Good Practice Guidelines, and the wetland methane emissions are assessed using the Tier 1 method, as shown in Table 2-1. \\\\\n",
      "2 & National Greenhouse Gas Inventories &  national, inventory, inventories, greenhouse & The National Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory for 2012 has been developed by the Yemen Government for its First Biennial Update Report under the UNFCCC. The 2012 National GHG Inventory has been prepared on the basis of the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, the 2000 IPCC Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National GHG Inventories, and Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, LandUse Change, and Forestry (LULUCF). It also includes the use of the global warming potential (GWP) factors recommended by the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines and the use of default emission factors recommended by IPCC. Activity data have been mainly obtained from national statistical reports and when data is lacking locally, severally international data sources have been accessed and used upon validation by national experts. this include the use.

      "3 & Manure Management & Livestock  &  manure, management, livestock, cattle & The methodology used to estimate N₂O and CH emissions from manure management is based on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories. The Tier 2 method was used to estimate CH4 emissions attributable to manure management in cattle, while the Tier 1 method was used for other animal species using emission factors per default of the IPCC. With respect to N₂O estimation from manure management, Tier 1 method was used with emission factors and parameters & Livestock production can result in methane (CH4) emissions from enteric fermentation (IPCC category 3.A.1) and both CH4 and nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions from livestock manure management systems fermentation (IPCC category 3.A.2). Usually, cattle are an important source of CH4 because of their large population and high CH4 emission rate due to their ruminant digestive system, as it is the situation in Mauritius. Methane emissions from manure management tend to be smaller than enteric emissions, with the most substantial emissions associated with confined animal management operations where manure is handled in liquidbased systems. Nitrous oxide emissions from manure management vary significantly between the types of management system used and can also result in indirect emissions due to other forms of nitrogen loss from the system. Manure management category, 3.A.2, only covers the volatilization in the farms, so emissions from animals in pasture are not included in category 3.A.2, but in category 3.C.4. The calculation of the nitrogen loss from manure management systems is also an important step in determining the amount of nitrogen that will ultimately be available in manure applied to managed soils, or used for feed, fuel, or construction purposes, emissions that are calculated 3.C.4 Direct N₂O emissions from managed soils. & Direct N₂O emissions from manure management were calculated from animal population data, activity data and manure management system data using Equation 10.25 and 10.30 from the IPCC 2006 Guidelines. Nitrogen excretion rates (N) for horses, mules/asses, swine and poultry were determined from data utilised in Du Toit et al. (2013c). For the other livestock the Africa default values (IPCC, 2006, Table 10.19) were applied. The typical animal mass (TAM) for the various livestock categories is provided in the livestock category sections below. Manure management data (Table 5.22) was used to produce the fraction of total annual nitrogen excretion for each livestock category managed in the various manure management systems. IPCC 2006 default N,O emission factors were used for the various manure management systems (IPCC 2006, Table 10.21). Weighted average N₂O emission factors for each livestock type were determined from the manure management usage data and the N₂O \\\\\n",
      "4 & Uncertainties &  uncertainty, uncertainties, data, activity & Regarding uncertainty, the uncertainties due to the Activity Data and the Emission Factors have been estimated for this sector. To estimate the uncertainty associated with the emissions in question, the uncertainties proposed by the 2006 IPCC Guidelines were considered for each source. & The uncertainty analysis and aggregated categories is based on Table 4.1 of Volume 1, Chapter 4 of 2006 IPCC Guidelines. Uncertainties from disaggregated levels are combined by multiplication according to Equation 3.1 of Volume 1, Chapter 3 of 2006 IPCC Guidelines using the default uncertainty values. For this analysis uncertainty in emissions or removals has been propagated from uncertainties in the activity data and other estimation parameters through the error propagation equation. & An uncertainty analysis was carried out to quantify the uncertainty of the compiled estimates and to help prioritise efforts to improve the accuracy of the inventory. Uncertainty values for activity data and emission factors were collected and included in the IPCC Inventory software, which calculates uncertainty using the Error Propagation methods (Approach 1). The overall uncertainty of the 2009 and 2019 estimates are 2% and 5%, respectively. The overall uncertainty of the 2009-2019 trend is also 5%. The values for the 2019 uncertainty analysis are provided in the Annex: Uncertainty assessment for GHG inventory.

      "9 & Production and Fuels &  production, fuels, industries, industrial & The Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) sector includes GHG emissions generated and emitted as the byproducts of non-energy-related industrial processes, which involve the chemical or physical transformation of raw materials and can release waste gases such as CO2, CH4, N₂O, and fluorinated gases (e.g., HFC-23). These processes include iron and steel production and metallurgical coke production, cement production, petrochemical production, ammonia production, lime production, other process uses of carbonates (e.g., flue gas desulfurization and soda ash consumption not associated with glass manufacturing), nitric acid production, adipic acid production, urea consumption for non-agricultural purposes, aluminum production, HCFC-22 production, glass production, soda ash production, ferroalloy production, titanium dioxide production, caprolactam production, zinc production, phosphoric acid production, lead production, and silicon carbide production and consumption. Most of these industries also emit CO₂ from fossil fuel combustion which, in line with IPCC sectoral definitions, is included in the Energy Sector. & Generally, the energy industries source category encompasses three main activities, viz., electricity and heat production (1.A.1.a), petroleum refining (1.A.1.b), and Manufacture of Solid Fuels and Other Energy Industries (1.A.1.c). According to the 2006 IPCC guidelines, the fossil fuels considered in this category are both raw materials for the conversion processes, and sources of energy to run these processes. The energy industry comprises the following three main kinds of activities: & Present energy conversion technologies rely mainly upon combustion of fossil fuels. During combustion carbon and hydrogen from fossil fuels are converted mainly into carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O), releasing as heat the fuel's chemical energy. This heat is generally either used directly, but more often for generating electricity or for transport. This sector includes two main combustion-related activities, namely stationary combustion and transport. Stationary combustion is responsible for about 70% of greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector.29 Stationary combustion practically includes all energy-consuming activities, except those of the transport sector (in addition to petrochemicals and fertilizers). About half of stationary combustion emissions are associated with combustion in energy industries, essentially power plants and refineries. The energy industry forms a part of this category: energy extraction, production and transformation, which includes power generation and petroleum refineries; manufacturing industries and construction: activities like iron and steel production, chemical manufacturing, paper, food industries, beverages and tobacco, and other sectors such as commerce and residential construction. Mobile combustion devoted to transport (road and other traffic) causes about one quarter of the emissions in the energy sector [IPCC, 2006]. \\\\\n",

The increase of emissions is mainly caused by increasing emissions from fuel combustion in Transport (IPCC subcategory 1.A.3) and in Manufacturing industries and construction (IPCC subcategory 1.A.2). & In 2017, greenhouse gas emissions from IPCC sector Energy amounted to 21,649.43 Gg CO₂ equivalents which correspond to about 50% of the total national emissions. Some 99% of the emissions from this sector, originate from IPCC category 1.A. Fossil Fuel Combustion. IPCC category 1.B Fugitive Emissions from fuels are of minor importance. From 1990 to 2017, emissions from this sector increased by 140%, from 2005 to 2017, emissions from this sector increased by 94%, and from 2016 to 2017, emissions from this sector increased by only 1%. The main increase occurred in the transport sector and by Manufacturing Industries and Construction due to higher consumption of fossil fuels. & In 2017, greenhouse gas emissions from IPCC sector Industrial Processes and Other Product Use (IPPU) amounted to 245.78 Gg CO₂ equivalents, which correspond to 0.6% of the total national emissions. From 1990 to 2017, emissions from this sector decreased by 0.9%, from 2005 to 2017, emissions from this sector increased by 50%, mainly due to a decrease in lime production. Between 2016 and 2017, emissions decreased by 12%, due to a significant decrease in emissions from category 2.A Mineral Industry. \\\\\n",

      "26 & Lime Production &  lime, production, carbonates, limestone & Lime production: The 1996 revised IPCC Guidelines propose a single estimation method where CO₂ emissions from lime manufacture are estimated by multiplying lime production by its corresponding emission factor. Considering that in Paraguay two types of lime are manufactured (calcic and dolomitic). The Tier 1 method is based on applying a default emission factor to national lime production data. Although for a good practice of Level 1 the information is not necessary & According to 2006 IPCC Guidelines, Vol. 3, Chap. 2.3.1.1, the Tier 1 method is based on applying a default emission factor to national level lime production data. While country-specific information on lime production by type (e.g., high calcium lime, dolomitic lime, or hydraulic lime) is not necessary for good practice in Tier 1, where data are available to identify the specific types of lime produced in the country, this may be used. It is not necessary for good practice to account for LKD in Tier 1. & CO₂ is released by heating limestone or calcium carbonate to break down the carbonates, this is usually done in reed kilns or rotary kilns at high temperatures. For the estimation of emissions from the production of lime, the Tier 2 method of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines was applied, based on the data of the national production of lime by type. Country-specific information is required at this level on the proportion of hydrated lime that is produced. The proportions by type of lime with respect to production of lime kiln dust (LKD) at the plant level should be obtained as shown in the following equation. \\\\\n",
      "27 & Waste Incineration &  waste, incineration, open, burning & default emission res according to the specifications by treatment technology. Similarly, default emission factors were used for CH emissions from open incineration of municipal solid waste. For their part, CO₂ emissions, estimated mainly for the categories of incineration and open incineration of waste, were calculated using the oxidation factors provided by the IPCC 2006 guidelines, as well as parameters necessary for the calculation. Consequently, Tier 2a was obtained since national statistics for the activity factor were incorporated. Finally, default emission factors were used for N₂O emissions from domestic wastewater treatment and disposal and open waste incineration. & According to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines waste incineration and open burning of waste produces emissions of CO₂, CH4 and N₂O. & According to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines waste incineration and open burning of waste produces emissions of CO₂, CH4 and N₂O. \\\\\n",
      "28 & Transport &  transport, aviation, fuel, road & Activity data on gasoline fuel consumption was sourced from SAPIA's annual reports (SAPIA, 2016), the DEA fuel consumption survey (DEA, 2019), while jet kerosene data was obtained from energy balance data and the DEA fuel consumption survey. It should however be noted that the SAPIA report indicates that data from 2009 are taken from the energy balance data anyway. The DEA fuel consumption survey was therefore used to calibrate the 2009 data contained in the DoE energy balances. The 2006 IPCC Guidelines (p. 3.78) require only domestic aviation to be included in the national totals. Hence, to separate international from domestic aviation, the DoE energy balances were used to estimate the ratio of domestic to international consumption. The DEA fuel consumption study is then used to quantify the actual fuel consumption for both international and domestic aviation. In the 2017 Inventory, DEA will implement the results of the updated DEA fuel consumption study to be completed in 2019. This will ensure that the energy balance data will be replaced by data sourced from the civil aviation industry. & The most important sources of GHGs in the IPCC category 1.A.3 Transport is Road Transport and Civil aviation. With regards to CO₂ emission, the source Road Transport was the primary source. & In the IPCC category 1.A.3 Transport, emissions originating from fuel combustion activities in civil aviation, in the road transport, railways, navigation and Other transport are considered. \\\\\n",
      "29 & Clinker and Cement Production &  clinker, cement, production, cao & GHG emissions from cement production were estimated using a Tier 2 methodology (2006 IPCC Guidelines), based on activity data on clinker production. Data obtained directly from the producer on CaO and MgO ratio in clinker and cement were used for calculating the CO₂ emission factors. & Cement production: The IPCC Good Practice Guidance (2000) presents two methods for estimating CO₂ emissions from cement production: Tier 1. Using data from cement production. Cement production data is used to estimate clinker production (taking into account the types of cement produced: Portland cement, pozzolanic cement, composite cement, blast furnace slag cement, etc.) and including clinker imports and exports (when it is possible). Regarding the Emission Factors, default factors were used: from O-IPCC, 3.1.1.1 p.3.10 (Clinker) and from D-IPCC1996, Reference Manual, 2.3.3.p.2.7 (Cement). & The methodology used to estimate CO₂ emissions is the Tier 2 method of the IPCC GHG inventory manual, which uses clinker production data and clinker lime content data. As for the estimate of SO₂ emissions from cement production, it was carried out by applying an emission factor excluding combustion to the annual production of cement. \\\\\n",

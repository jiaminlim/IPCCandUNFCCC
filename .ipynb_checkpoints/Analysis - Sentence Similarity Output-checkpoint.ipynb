The scientific consensus on climate change attested by the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is striking (i) the warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and the influence of man is established; (ii) climate change has had impacts on natural and human systems, including food production: (i) the risk of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts is increasingly high; and (iv) the period from 2000 to 2010 saw the highest levels of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in human history, reaching 49 Giga tonnes CO2 equivalent in 2010. In the opinion of the IPCC, even if human activity is only the source of about 5% of all GHGs (natural processes being the cause of the rest), this is enough to disturb the delicate balance of the climate (IPCC, 2007) . The consequence is that the atmosphere continues to heat up and evolve in its composition.

Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings such as modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions and persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use. Note that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in its Article 1, defines climate change as: \"a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.\" The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between climate change attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric composition and climate variability attributable to natural causes (IPCC, 2018, p.544). & TTO & Trinidad and Tobago.

These inventories were compiled at Tier 1 level using the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC, 1997). These inventories have all been compiled using the sectoral bottom-up approach. The reference approach has also been used for the Energy sector, to enable comparison of the two methods. The gases estimated were carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₂), nitrous oxide (N₂O), Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO₂), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and the precursor carbon monoxide (CO). A third Inventory has been compiled using a mix of Tiers 1 and 2 for the BUR1 and submitted to the UNFCCC in 2014. The fourth, fifth and sixth inventories have been submitted as stand-alone national inventory reports (NIR). The IPCC 2006 Guidelines and software were used for compiling these inventories.

Tier 1 method combines the uncertainty in activity rates and emission factors, for each source category and GHG, and then aggregates these uncertainties, for all source categories and GHGs, to obtain the total uncertainty for the inventory. In many cases uncertainty values have been assigned based on default uncertainty estimates according to IPCC guidelines or expert judgement, because there is a lack of the information. For each source, uncertainties are quantified for emission factors and activity data.","All the methodologies and tools used for GHG inventory reporting followed the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC, 2006), Good Practice Guidance, and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC, 2000).

Default IPCC emission factors were used for the calculation of GHG emissions from basic oxygen furnace, electric furnace and pig iron production, direct reduced iron production and sinter. The separation of energy and process emissions emanating from the use of coke was not done due to a lack of disaggregated information on coke consumption. Hence, energy-related emissions from iron and steel production have been accounted for through the application of default IPCC emission factors.","Confidence in the key findings of this assessment is communicated using the IPCC calibrated uncertainty language. This calibrated language is designed to consistently evaluate and communicate uncertainties that arise from incomplete knowledge due to a lack of information or from disagreement about what is known or even knowable. The IPCC calibrated language uses qualitative expressions of confidence based on the robustness of evidence for a finding and (where possible) uses quantitative expressions to describe the likelihood of a finding. Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers, very low, low, medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, for example, medium confidence. The following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: virtually certain 99-100% probability, very likely 90-100%, likely 66-100%, as likely as not 33-66%, unlikely 0-33%, very unlikely 0-10%, exceptionally unlikely 0-1%.

As for the estimate of SO₂ emissions from cement production, it was carried out by applying an emission factor excluding combustion to the annual production of cement.","According to the 2006 IPCC, the emissions level is estimated using reference and sectoral approaches. The reference approach is a top-down approach, using a country's energy supply data to calculate the emissions of CO₂ from combustions of fossil fuels, while the sectoral approach is a bottom-up approach, using fuel data of stationary as well as mobile combustions in several sectors of energy category to calculate CO2, CH2, N₂O emissions. It is good practice to apply both sectoral and reference approaches to estimate a country's CO₂ emissions from fuel combustion and to compare the results of these two estimates.

Under RCP 8.5, the projected decrease was larger: 8.6-14.2% and 20.5-24.1% by the mid- and end of the 21st century (Figure 5.18). The trends agree with the projected changes in total marine animal biomass for the 21st century (Blanchard et al 2017; Lotze et al. 2018) (Section 5.2.3). A single fisheries model with atmospheric warming projected a potential catch loss of 3.4 million tonnes and decreases of 6.4% of catch potential of the exploited species per degree Celsius atmospheric warming relative to 1951-1960 level (Cheung et al 2016b) (Figure 5.18). Interactions between temperature, net primary production and transfer efficiency of energy across the foodweb are projected to amplify these trends, with projected decreases greater than 50% in some regions by 2100 under high emissions scenarios (Stock et al. 2017). Thus, there is high model agreement that ocean warming and changes in NPP in the 21st century will reduce the global maximum catch potential, particularly in tropical oceans (high confidence) and alter the distribution and composition of exploited species (high confidence). The projected risk of these fisheries impacts increases with increasing greenhouse gas emissions (high confidence). However, given the uncertainties of projected changes in ocean conditions from ESMS (Section 5.2.2), and that most global scale fisheries models are largely driven by changes in temperature and primary production while other changes in ocean biogeochemical changes are not explicitly considered (Tittensor et al. 2018), the quantitative magnitude of the projected changes in maximum catch potential is considered to have medium and low confidence at global and regional scales, respectively. Given the significant interactions between catch potential and level of fisheries exploitation, the realised catches in the 21st century would depend on future scenarios of fishing and fisheries governance (Section 5.4.2, 5.5). As a result, projections of realised catches have low confidence.","For the estimation of Forest related GHG emissions and removals, Belize has followed the methodologies proposed in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, Volume 4, Chapter 2 ""Generic Methodologies Applicable to Multiple Land-use Categories"", for biomass carbon stock changes (above-ground biomass and below-ground biomass) and non-CO2 emissions.

Other applications, such as aerosols, solvent cleaning, and foam blowing exist in Rwanda; however, there is a lack of inventory data to estimate these sources of emissions.","- The 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC, 2006);","Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.","Metal production includes the production of metals such as iron and steel. The quantity of iron and steel produced in 2000 was 2.7 and 7.6 kt respectively. Emission factors were the default values recommended by the IPCC 2006. For iron production, default CO2 emission factor from pig iron production was used and as for steel production, CO₂ emission was calculated by electric arc furnace steel making method.","Agreement In this Report, the degree of agreement within the scientific body of knowledge on a particular finding is assessed based on multiple lines of evidence (e.g., mechanistic understanding, theory, data, models, expert judgement) and expressed qualitatively (Mastrandrea et al., 2010). See also Confidence, Likelihood, Uncertainty and Evidence.","CO₂ is released by heating limestone or calcium carbonate to break down the carbonates, this is usually done in reed kilns or rotary kilns at high temperatures. For the estimation of emissions from the production of lime, the Tier 2 method of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines was applied, based on the data of the national production of lime by type. Country-specific information is required at this level on the proportion of hydrated lime that is produced. The proportions by type of lime with respect to production of lime kiln dust (LKD) at the plant level should be obtained as shown in the following equation.",factors used during the compilation of this inventory. All estimates were made via the use of the IPCC 2006 inventory software.,"GHG emissions from cement production were estimated using a Tier 2 methodology (2006 IPCC Guidelines), based on activity data on clinker production. Data obtained directly from the producer on CaO and MgO ratio in clinker and cement were used for calculating the CO₂ emission factors.","In accordance with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, it is good practice to apply both the Sectoral Approach (bottom-up methodology) and the Reference Approach (top-down methodology) to estimate CO2 emissions from fuel combustion and to compare the results of both independent estimates. The Reference Approach is a method applied to energy supply as apparent consumption. Based on the reported fuel consumption, each fuel has a carbon content that was used to estimate GHG emissions. Figure 2-7 shows the differences between reference and sectoral approaches over the period 2000-2019. The discrepancy between the two emissions, ranged between -5.0% to +8.5%. With the exception of some years, emissions calculated by reference approach generally exceeded the sectoral approach."

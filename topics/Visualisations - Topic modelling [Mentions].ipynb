According to these reports, human activities have been responsible for approximately 1.0°C of global warming since pre-industrial times, and temperature rise is likely to breach 1.5°C between 2030 and 2052 at current rates of warming. More intense and frequent climate and weather extremes have been observed. Warming from historical anthropogenic emissions since the pre-industrial period will continue to drive long-term shifts in the climate system such as sea level rise. According to the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate, under a \"business-as-usual\" (RCP8.5) scenario, global mean sea level rise could increase to 1.1m by 2100, which is 10cm above the most likely estimate from the Fifth Assessment Report released in 2014. This is due to a larger projected ice mass loss from the Antarctica ice sheet. \\\\\\\\\\n2 & Carbon Accounting in Forest Management & Emissions from Forest Management & Emissions from Forest Management & GHG Emissions - Agriculture & LULUCF &  land, forest, biomass, carbon & Methodologies applied in this national inventory were based on the Revised 1996 IPCC Guideline for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC, 1997) and the uncertainty analysis of the activity data and emission factor was undertaken according to the Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (IPCC, 2003). Forest carbon pools were classified into 6 categories including living above-ground biomasses, living below-ground biomasses, dead wood, litter, soil organic carbon and harvested wood products (IPCC, 1997). Only the fate and amount of aboveground biomass, however, were taken into account. Appropriate methodology tiers, either with or without change of forest land to other land use were chosen according to the Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (IPCC, 2003). Similar to previous reports, Thailand adopted multiple tiers in the national GHG inventory for LULUCF sector in this report. Activity data were obtained from the interpretation of satellite imageries and statistical reports from relevant agencies. Tier 2 emission factors were adopted in most activities using country-specific data from local publications and IPCC defaults were applied as Tier 1 emission factors when appropriate. This was mostly for estimation of non-CO, trace gases emissions. For 5A Changes in Forest and Other Woody Biomass Stocks, the annual increment in biomass, wood density and carbon fraction of dry matter for EFS estimation were obtained from local publications that were reported in the Guideline of the Potential Tree Species Used for Promoting under Clean Development Mechanism by Faculty of Forestry (1997). Reviewing more recent research in regards to large areas and tree samples showed that the average annual biomass increment decreased. Therefore, the EFs used in this study were lower than those used in the previous report. For 5B Forest and Grassland Conversion, the aboveground biomass by forest type before conversion, carbon fraction of dry matter by forest type were obtained from local publications. Fractions of biomass burned on-site and off-site by forest type and fraction of biomass left to decay by forest type were country-specific data, which was obtained from the literature review and expert judgment. For 5C Abandonment of Managed Lands, the supporting data for estimating Tier 2 EFs were the annual rates of aboveground biomass growth for land abandoned in the last twenty years and land abandoned between 20 and 100 years ago classified by forest type. These were country-specific data derived from the literature reviews and expert judgment considered Tier 2. \\\\\\\\\\n3 & Livestock Manure Management & Emissions from Livestock Manure Management & Emissions from Livestock Manure Management & GHG Emissions - Agriculture & LULUCF &  manure, management, livestock, cattle & The methodology used to estimate the emission factors corresponded to level 2 of the IPCC. Country-specific methane emission factors, Enteric Fermentation and Manure Management, and nitrogen excretion factors were estimated for the calculation of nitrous oxide by Manure Management (included in \\\\\\\\\\n4 & Waste Management and Treatment & Emissions from Solid Waste Disposal & Emissions from Solid Waste Disposal & GHG Emissions - Waste &  waste, wastewater, solid, treatment & Based on the country context and the data availability, 4.A - Solid Waste Disposal, 4.B - Biological Treatment of Solid Waste, 4.C - Incineration and Open Burning of Waste, 4.D - Wastewater and Treatment and Discharge categories are reported under the waste sector. The GHG emissions were estimated using either available data from various literature or by using default values provided in the 2006 IPCC guidelines. The current results show a slight growth of emissions in all subcategories mainly due to the increasing population in the same period and changes in the main mode of waste management. \\\\\\\\\\n5 & Uncertainty Assessment in Emissions Inventory & Uncertainties in Inventory Estimates & Uncertainties in Inventory Estimates & GHG Emisions Measurement & Methods (General) &  uncertainty, uncertainties, data, activity & The uncertainty of the LULUCF sector activity data comes mainly from the estimation error of the geospatial data. While the uncertainties of the emission factors used come from the default values of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. The uncertainty of the activity data has been included in the uncertainty calculation process and are reported together as uncertainties of emission factors. \\\\\\\\\\n6 & Citation of IPCC Guidelines Equations & Citations of 2006 IPCC guidelines & Citations of 2006 IPCC guidelines & GHG Emisions Measurement & Methods (General) &  2006, chapter, volume, page & Equation 3.2 (chapter 3 of the 2006 IPCC guidelines Volume 1): \\\\\\\\\\n7 & Energy Fuel Consumption & Emissions from Fuels & Energy & Emissions from Fuels & Energy & GHG Emissions - Energy &  fuels, energy, fuel, consumption & According to the guidelines of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, the emissions associated with the consumption of fossil fuels in the fuel tanks of international air and maritime transport, and the CO2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, are estimated and reported separately from the national total. biomass for energy purposes. \\\\\\\\\\n8 & Global Warming Potential (GWP) Reporting & Global Warming Potential Values & Global Warming Potential Values & GHG Emisions Measurement & Methods (General) &  gwp, warming, report, global & The estimated CH4, N₂O, HFCs and SF emissions were converted to CO₂ equivalent (CO2 eq) using Global Warming Potentials (GWPS) values provided by the IPCC in its Second Assessment Report (\"1995 IPCC GWP Values\") based on the effects of GHGS over a 100-year time horizon (Table 2.1). \\\\\\\\\\n9 & Default Emission Factor Calculation (2006 IPCC Guidelines) & Emission Factors from 2006 IPCC Guidelines & Emission Factors from 2006 IPCC Guidelines & GHG Emisions Measurement & Methods (General) &  factors, default, 2006, calculation & Emission factors are used by default from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. \\\\\\\\\\n10 & National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Guidelines & National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 1 & National Greenhouse Gas Inventories & GHG Emisions Measurement & Methods (General) &  greenhouse, gas, inventories, national & as well as 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. \\\\\\\\\\n11 & National GHG Inventory Compilation & National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 2 & National Greenhouse Gas Inventories & GHG Emisions Measurement & Methods (General) &  inventory, ghg, national, inventories & This Third National Communication (TNC) details a comprehensive national GHG emission inventory by sources and removals by sinks for the base years 2006 and 2012 using comparable methodologies of IPCC 2006.

The increase of emissions is mainly caused by increasing emissions from Enteric Fermentation and Manure Management (IPCC subcategory 3.A and 3.B) and Agricultural Soils (IPCC subcategory 3.D). \\\\\\\\\\n15 & Tiered Method for Emission Factor Calculation & Tier methods for Estimating Inventory & Tier methods/approaches for Estimating Inventory & GHG Emisions Measurement & Methods (General) &  tier, factors, method, default & For the estimation of GHG emissions for the category, Tier 1 and Tier 2 methods were applied for the subcategories, using disaggregated country-specific activity data and default emission factors in accordance with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. \\\\\\\\\\n16 & QA/QC Procedures in Inventory Compilation & QA/QC Procedures in Inventory Compilation & QA/QC Procedures in Inventory Compilation & GHG Emisions Measurement & Methods (General) &  qc, quality, qaqc, procedures & The general and category-specific QC procedures are performed by the experts during inventory calculation and compilation according to the QA/QC and verification plan. The QC procedures used in Finland\\'s GHG inventory comply with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. General inventory QC checks (2006 IPCC Guidelines, Vol 1, Chapter 6, Table 6.1) include routine checks of the integrity, correctness and completeness of the data, identification of errors and deficiencies, and documentation and archiving of the inventory data and quality control actions. Category-specific QC checks including reviews of the activity data, emission factors and methods are applied on a case-by-case basis focusing on key categories and on categories where significant methodological changes or data revisions have taken place. \\\\\\\\\\n17 & Greenhouse Gas Inventory Composition & Greenhouse Gas Inventory Composition & Greenhouse Gas Inventory Composition & GHG Emisions Measurement & Methods (General) &  dioxide, gases, inventory, nox & This NIRS covers the full territory of the country for the recommended time series 1990 to 2016 and the results are presented at the national level. The inventory addressed all the IPCC sectors Energy, Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU), Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) and Waste and categories subject to Activity Data (AD) availability. The gases covered in this inventory are the direct gases carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N₂O) and hydro-fluorocarbons (HFCs) as well as the indirect gases nitrogen oxides (NO₂), carbon monoxide (CO), non-methane organic volatile compounds (NMVOCs) and sulphur dioxide (SO₂). \\\\\\\\\\n18 & Refrigeration and Air Conditioning HFC Usage & Emissions from Refridgeration and Hydroflourocarbons (HFCs) & Emissions from Refridgeration and Hydroflourocarbons (HFCs) & GHG Emissions - IPPU &  refrigeration, hfc, conditioning, air & Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and, to a very limited extent, perfluorocarbons (PFCs), have high global warming potentials and are being used as alternatives to different classes of ozone-depleting substances (ODS) that are being phased out under the Montreal Protocol. According to the IPCC 2006 guidelines, HFCs and PFCs are being used in a variety of applications that includes refrigeration and air conditioning, fire suppression and explosion protection, aerosols, solvent cleaning, foam blowing, and other applications such as equipment\\'s sterilization. \\\\\\\\\\n19 & Key Categories Analysis & Key Categories Analysis & Key Categories Analysis & GHG Emisions Measurement & Methods (General) &  key, categories, trend, level & According to the IPCC definition, a key category is one that is prioritized within the national inventory system because its estimate has a significant influence on a country\\'s total inventory of direct GHGs in terms of the absolute level of emissions, the trend in emissions, or both. Total emissions from the key categories amount to 95% of the total emissions included in the inventory. Key categories for Lebanon are determined with Approach 1 described in Volume 1, Chapter 4 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 4 categories have been identified as key in the analysis, with CO₂ being the main gas and the energy sector being the main key category. Analyses of key categories is performed collectively for all sectors and a list of all key categories is presented in Table 10. \\\\\\\\\\n20 & Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) Sector Analysis & Emissions from Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) & Emissions from Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) & GHG Emissions - Agriculture & LULUCF &  afolu, sector, categories, 3a & The main categories of the inventory were obtained following Method 1 by evaluation of level, tendency and uncertainty. For this, the emissions and removals in absolute value were taken into account based on the participation that each source has in the inventory until 95% of the total was covered. This analysis was carried out following the guidelines established in Table 4.1 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines (Volume 1, Chapter 4) to determine the level of aggregation of the categories of the Energy, PIUP and Waste sectors. In the case of the AGSOUT sector, given that it contains several significant subcategories, the recommendation was made to carry out the analysis of main categories with a higher level of disaggregation. In particular, category 3A was subdivided into 3A1ai Dairy cattle; 3A1aii Beef cattle and 3A1ab-j Other livestock. Regarding subcategories 3C4 and 3C5, they are broken down by type of animal production following the same criteria as in category 3A, by harvest residues, by synthetic fertilizers and by direct N₂O emissions due to the loss of organic matter from the soil. . On the other hand, since Argentina has a consistent representation of Method 1 lands, it is not possible to assign the changes in soil carbon to land use categories 3B1 to 3B6. For this reason, a new subcategory *3B7-Variation of soil organic matter (carbon)&quot; was generated to report the change in total soil carbon corresponding to the area of the country included in the coherent representation of lands, and it is this subcategory 3B7 that included in the main category analysis. \\\\\\\\\\n21 & Industrial Carbonate Calcination Processes & Emissions from Industrial Carbonate Calcination Processes & Emissions from Industrial Carbonate Calcination Processes & GHG Emissions - IPPU &  lime, glass, production, soda & According to 2006 IPCC Guidelines, Vol. 3, Chap. 2.3.1.1, the Tier 1 method is based on applying a default emission factor to national level lime production data. While country-specific information on lime production by type (e.g., high calcium lime, dolomitic lime, or hydraulic lime) is not necessary for good practice in Tier 1, where data are available to identify the specific types of lime produced in the country, this may be used. It is not necessary for good practice to account for LKD in Tier 1. \\\\\\\\\\n22 & Cement Clinker Production Emissions & Emissions from Cement Clinker Production & Emissions from Cement Clinker Production & GHG Emissions - IPPU &  cement, clinker, production, cao & GHG emissions from cement production were estimated using a Tier 2 methodology (2006 IPCC Guidelines), based on activity data on clinker production. Data obtained directly from the producer on CaO and MgO ratio in clinker and cement were used for calculating the CO₂ emission factors. \\\\\\\\\\n23 & Quality Control for Activity Data and Emission Factors & Activity Data and Emission Factors & Activity Data and Emission Factors & GHG Emisions Measurement & Methods (General) &  activity, data, sources, factors & As a quality control, the recommendations indicated in Chapter 6 - Volume 1 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines were followed. Additionally, the hypotheses used for the selection of the activity data, the appropriate calculation methodologies, the selection of emission factors and calculations. Likewise, the transcription of the activity data from the original sources to the spreadsheets was reviewed, mainly contrasting the totals of the original reports, with the sums made in the spreadsheets. \\\\\\\\\\n24 & Estimating GHG Emissions using IPCC Tier 1 Approach & Tier approaches for Estimating Inventory & Tier methods/approaches for Estimating Inventory & GHG Emisions Measurement & Methods (General) &  tier, ch4, approach, method & For estimating the GHG emissions (CO₂, CH4, N₂O) the 2006 IPCC Guidelines Tier 1 approach has been applied: \\\\\\\\\\n25 & GHG Emissions from Iron and Steel Production & Emissions from Iron and Steel Production & Emissions from Iron and Steel Production & GHG Emissions - IPPU &  steel, production, iron, coke & A Tier I approach (country-specific emission factors) was applied to calculate the emissions from iron and steel production for the different process types in 2017. Default IPCC emission factors were used for the calculation of GHG emissions from basic oxygen furnace, electric furnace and pig iron production, direct reduced iron production and sinter. The separation of energy and process emissions emanating from the use of coke was not done due to a lack of disaggregated information on coke consumption. Hence, energy-related emissions from iron and steel production have been accounted for through the application of default IPCC emission factors. \\\\\\\\\\n26 & GHG Emissions Estimation: Reference vs Sectoral Approach & GHG Emissions Estimation: Reference vs Sectoral Approach & GHG Emissions Estimation: Reference vs Sectoral Approach & GHG Emisions Measurement & Methods (General) &  reference, approach, sectoral, fuel & According to the 2006 IPCC, the emissions level is estimated using reference and sectoral approaches. The reference approach is a top-down approach, using a country\\'s energy supply data to calculate the emissions of CO₂ from combustions of fossil fuels, while the sectoral approach is a bottom-up approach, using fuel data of stationary as well as mobile combustions in several sectors of energy category to calculate CO2, CH2, N₂O emissions. It is good practice to apply both sectoral and reference approaches to estimate a country\\'s CO₂ emissions from fuel combustion and to compare the results of these two estimates. Figure 2-3 presents GHG emissions level estimated under reference approach by type of fuels and under sectoral approach by type of sector category. In 2015, GHG emissions by sectoral approach reached 4,437 Gg CO2e, while by reference approach were 4,441 Gg CO2e. \\\\\\\\\\n27 & GHG Key Category Analysis: IPCC Tier 2 Level & Key Category Level Analysis & Key Categories Analysis & GHG Emisions Measurement & Methods (General) &  key, analysis, categories, level & Table 5.8 presents the results of the IPCC Tier 2 key category level analysis for the year 2019. There is a total of 21 key categories based on the Tier 2 current year level analysis, with LULUCF. \\\\\\\\\\n28 & Inventory Completeness Assessment and Software Utilization & Inventory Completeness Assessment & Inventory Completeness Assessment & GHG Emisions Measurement & Methods (General) &  inventory, software, completeness, source & An assessment of the completeness of the inventory was made for individual activity areas within each source category and the results are presented within the sections covering the individual sectors. The methodology adopted was according to the IPCC 2006 Guidelines (IPCC 2007) with the following notation keys used: \\\\\\\\\\n29 & Wetlands Emission Estimation and IPCC Supplement Utilization & Emissions from Wetlands Supplement & Emissions from Wetlands Supplement & GHG Emissions - Agriculture & LULUCF &  wetlands, supplement, reservoirs, peatlands & (IPCC 2006).

Integrated water management (medium confidence) and ecosystem-based adaptation (high confidence) approaches lower climate risks locally and provide multiple societal benefits. However, ecological, financial, institutional and governance constraints for such actions exist (high confidence), and in many contexts ecosystem-based adaptation will only be effective under the lowest levels of warming (high confidence). (2.3.1, 2.3.3, 3.2.4, 3.5.2, 3.5.4, 4.4.2, 5.2.2, 5.4.2, 5.5.1, 5.5.2, Figure SPM.5)","Figure 3.21 | The dependence of risks and/or impacts associated with the Reasons for Concern (RFCs) on the level of climate change, updated and adapted from WGII ARS Ch 19, Figure 19.4 and highlighting the nature of this dependence between 0°C and 2°C warming above pre-industrial levels. As in the ARS, literature was used to make expert judgements to assess the levels of global warming at which levels of impact and/or risk are undetectable (white), moderate (yellow), high (red) or very high (purple). The colour scheme thus indicates the additional risks due to climate change. The transition from red to purple, introduced for the first time in AR4, is defined by very high risk of severe impacts and the presence of significant irreversibility, or persistence of climate-related hazards combined with a limited ability to adapt due to the nature of the hazard or impact. Comparison of the increase of risk across RFCs indicates the relative sensitivity of RFCs to increases in GMST. As was done previously, this assessment takes autonomous adaptation into account, as well as limits to adaptation (RFC 1, 3, 5) independently of development pathway. The rate and timing of impacts were taken into account in assessing RFC 1 and 5. The levels of risk illustrated reflect the judgements of the Ch 3 authors. RFC1 Unique and threatened systems: ecological and human systems that have restricted geographic ranges constrained by climate related conditions and have high endemism or other distinctive properties. Examples include coral reefs, the Arctic and its indigenous people, mountain glaciers and biodiversity hotspots. RFC2 Extreme weather events: risks/impacts to human health, livelihoods, assets and ecosystems from extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rain, drought and associated wildfires, and coastal flooding. RFC3 Distribution of impacts: risks/impacts that disproportionately affect particular groups due to uneven distribution of physical climate change hazards, exposure or vulnerability. RFC4 Global aggregate impacts: global monetary damage, global scale degradation and loss of ecosystems and biodiversity. RFCS Large-scale singular events: are relatively large, abrupt and sometimes irreversibile changes in systems that are caused by global warming. Examples include disintegration of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. The grey bar represents the range of GMST for the most recent decade: 2006-2015.","Climate change will increasingly put pressure on food production and access, especially in vulnerable regions, undermining food security and nutrition (high confidence). Increases in frequency, intensity and severity of droughts, floods and heatwaves, and continued sea level rise will increase risks to food security (high confidence) in vulnerable regions from moderate to high between 1.5°C and 2°C global warming level, with no or low levels of adaptation (medium confidence). At 2°C or higher global warming level in the mid-term, food security risks due to climate change will be more severe, leading to malnutrition and micro-nutrient deficiencies, concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Central and South America and Small Islands (high confidence). Global warming will progressively weaken soil health and ecosystem services such as pollination, increase pressure from pests and diseases, and reduce marine animal biomass, undermining food productivity in many regions on land and in the ocean (medium confidence). At 3°C or higher global warming level in the long term, areas exposed to climate-related hazards will expand substantially compared with 2°C or lower global warming level (high confidence), exacerbating regional disparity in food security risks (high confidence).

1,1,"The inventory was conducted using the Revised 1996 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, hereinafter referred to as the IPCC Guidelines and the IPCC Good Practice Guidance 2000, for estimating and reporting on its national GHG inventory. In this regard emissions factors used were those provided in the IPCC guidelines; default factors for energy, industrial processes, agriculture, land use change and forestry and waste.",The methodology adopted is based on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. GHG emissions and removals were calculated using the IPCC 2006 inventory software using the Tier 1 method.,All of the estimates presented in this report were calculated using national-level activity data and IPCC default emission factors. Full details of all the activity data and emission factors used (including their source) are documented in the methodologies report.

2,2,"The waste sector releases CO, CH, and N O gases from solid waste disposal, biological treatment of solid waste, incineration, open burning of waste and wastewater treatment and discharge (IPCC, 2006). Solid waste disposal is commonly carried out through land filling, composting, incineration and conversion of waste to energy. The most common GHG produced from Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) disposal in Solid Waste Dumping Sites (SWDSS) is methane. In addition, CO, and NMVOCs as well as small amounts of N O produce in the disposal sites. The primary source of CO₂ from waste is the decomposition of organic matter derived from biomass sources. Based on 2006 IPCC-GL, CO₂ emission from biogenic waste was not considered under the waste sector.","Methodological approaches for estimating greenhouse gas emission in waste sector followed the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories (IPCC, 2007) and were supported by the 2000 IPCC Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC, 2000). Tier 1 and Tier 2 methods were applied depending on the availability of data. Estimating CH emissions from 6A Solid Waste Disposal on Land used the first order decay (FOD) model with Tier 2 level as described in the 2000 IPCC Good Practice Guidance (GPG). Emission factors used in this report were a mix of default emission factors presented in the IPCC guidelines and country-specific emission factors. Methane generation potential (L) and degradable organic carbon (DOC) were derived from municipal solid waste (MSW) composition which was country specific data. Methane generation rate constant (k), methane correction factor (MCF), fraction DOC dissimilated (DOC), fraction by volume of CH in landfill gas (F), and oxidation factor corresponded to the recommended values from the 2000 IPCC Good Practice Guidance and the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. GHG emissions including CO₂ and NO from 6C Waste Incineration, however, were estimated by Tier 1 method presented in the 2000 IPCC GPG. Activity data used in estimation of GHG from waste incineration consisted of the amount of incinerated waste, fraction of carbon content in waste, and fraction of fossil carbon in waste. Waste types considered in this report included MSW, clinical waste, and industrial waste. The amount of MSW and clinical waste incinerated were reported by the Pollution Control Department (PCD), while industrial waste was provided by the Department of Industrial Works (DIW). It was noted that the GHG emissions from some MSW incineration facilities, where energy was recovered, were accounted for the energy sector. Emission factors for waste incineration used the default values presented in the 2000 IPCC GPG and the 2006 IPCC guidelines.","The scope of the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for the Waste sector gives methodological guidance for estimation of carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₂) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions from Solid waste disposal, Biological treatment of solid waste, Incineration and open burning of waste, and Waste water treatment and discharge emissions from the Municipal Solid Waste (MSW). GHG emissions originating from the Waste Sector were estimated using a Tier 1 approach as per the IPCC, 2006 Guidelines and default emission factor for National GHG Inventories. The estimation of GHG emission from waste sector considers only the solid waste disposal and open burning of waste in this inventory. The result of aggregate GHG emission from waste sector in 2018 is 33.07 GgCO2-eq. the highest GHG emission contributor came from the solid waste disposal accounting for 97% and the remaining 3% was from open burning of waste (Figure 3.12).",2_waste_2006_manure_used,2431,6.845187813256744
3,3,"For the estimation of Forest related GHG emissions and removals, Belize has followed the methodologies proposed in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, Volume 4, Chapter 2 ""Generic Methodologies Applicable to Multiple Land-use Categories"", for biomass carbon stock changes (above-ground biomass and below-ground biomass) and non-CO2 emissions. It includes the analysis for forest land remaining in the same land-use forest land converted to a new land-use category, and other land use to forest lands.","The construction of PNG's FRL and its corresponding Technical Annex and GHG inventory of LULUCF sector were based on IPCC methodology. PNG used the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and Good Practice Guidelines LULUCF as a basis for estimating anthropogenic forest-related greenhouse gas emissions and removals resulting from changes in carbon stocks in forest land converted to other land-use categories (Deforestation), forest land remaining forest land (Forest degradation) and non-forest land to forest land (Carbon stock enhancement)"". Forest land was stratified by forest type and type of disturbance. Historical annual emissions were estimated using emission factors appropriate to various forest strata, derived from scientific literature and the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, and activity data obtained through the Collect Earth assessment"". FRL values for the period 2014-2018 were projected using an equation based on a linear regression model.","In the national context, the subcategories of Forest Land Remaining Forest Land and Land Converted to Forest Land for Biomass Storage were estimated, due to data availability. In each land use and land use change category, carbon stock changes are estimated in the following three pools: biomass (aboveground and below ground), dead organic matter (litter and dead wood), and soils ( soil organic matter). In the case of this category, only the CO₂ emissions and removals from the biomass pool are presented, since, due to the lack of data on dead organic matter and soil carbon, it is assumed that C in these pools is in equilibrium, in accordance with the provisions of the Tier 1 method of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.",3_land_forest_biomass_carbon,2327,6.552345553866081
4,4,"The uncertainty of emission estimates has been evaluated. For activity data, an uncertainty value of 5% has been used for categories except liquid fuels, which are considered to have an uncertainty value of 1%. The emission factors are default values from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, so their corresponding uncertainty values have been used.","An uncertainty analysis was carried out to quantify the uncertainty of the compiled estimates and to help prioritise efforts to improve the accuracy of the inventory. Uncertainty values for activity data and emission factors were collected and included in the IPCC Inventory software, which calculates uncertainty using the Error Propagation methods (Approach 1). The overall uncertainty of the 2009 and 2019 estimates are 2% and 5%, respectively. The overall uncertainty of the 2009-2019 trend is also 5%. The values for the 2019 uncertainty analysis are provided in the Annex: Uncertainty assessment for GHG inventory. The category-level uncertainties are provided in the sector summary tables in the sector chapters. Further discussion regarding the uncertainties is also provided in these chapters.","The uncertainty estimate of the 2017 inventory has been done according to the Tier 1 method presented by the IPCC 2006 GL. Tier 1 method combines the uncertainty in activity rates and emission factors, for each source category and GHG, and then aggregates these uncertainties, for all source categories and GHG-s, to obtain the total uncertainty for the inventory. In many cases uncertainty values have been assigned based on default uncertainty estimates according to IPCC guidelines or expert judgement, because there is a lack of the information. For each source, uncertainties are quantified for emission factors and activity data.",4_uncertainty_uncertainties_data_activity,1137,3.2015543166075346

8,8,"Improvement has also been made in the estimation of GHG emissions from industrial wastewater treatment. Instead of using the default values of IPCC 2006 GLs, the GHG emissions level was estimated using parameters collected from industries, i.e. wastewater flow rate, wastewater COD level and also types of wastewater treatment facilities.","Wastewater is derived from a variety of domestic, commercial, and industrial sources and may be treated on-site (uncollected), sewed to a centralized plant (collected), or disposed of untreated nearby or via an outfall. Domestic wastewater is defined as wastewater from household water use, while industrial wastewater is from industrial practices only (IPCC, 2006). Considering that, the methodology is on a per person basis, emissions from commercial wastewater are estimated as part of domestic wastewater. To avoid misunderstanding, the term municipal wastewater was not used in this report. Municipal wastewater is a mixture of household, commercial and non-hazardous industrial wastewater, treated at wastewater treatment plants (IPCC, 2006).","The CH. emissions from industrial wastewater have been calculated using the IPCC Tier 1 methodology proposed by IPCC 2006.

Emissions of SO, and direct and indirect greenhouse gases from energy sources, comprising CO₂, CH, NO, NO, CO and NMVOCs were estimated by using activity data (AD) reported in the national statistics, as well as, the default emission factors of related fuels provided by the IPCC. The net calorific value (NCV) of each fuel, however, followed the official annual reports of the Ministry of Energy.","C.2 The far-reaching services and options provided by ocean and cryosphere-related ecosystems can be supported by protection, restoration, precautionary ecosystem-based management of renewable resource use, and the reduction of pollution and other stressors (high confidence). Integrated water management (medium confidence) and ecosystem-based adaptation (high confidence) approaches lower climate risks locally and provide multiple societal benefits. However, ecological, financial, institutional and governance constraints for such actions exist (high confidence), and in many contexts ecosystem-based adaptation will only be effective under the lowest levels of warming (high confidence).

Emissions are then summed over all manure management systems. The Tier 1 method is applied using IPCC default N₂O emission factors, default nitrogen excretion data, and default manure management system data.","The uncertainty of emission estimates has been evaluated. For activity data, an uncertainty value of 5% has been used for categories except liquid fuels, which are considered to have an uncertainty value of 1%. The emission factors are default values from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, so their corresponding uncertainty values have been used.","The subcategories 4.A.1 Managed waste disposal sites, 4.A.2 Unmanaged waste disposal sites, 4.B.2 Biological treatment of solid waste, 4.C.1 Waste incineration, and 4.

In the Third National Communication (TNC), the GHG inventory considered the time-frame 2003 - 2009. In these reports, the inventory was developed in accordance with the 1996 Revised IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and the 2000 IPCC Good Practice Guidance. In the First Biennial Update Report (FBUR), the inventory was compiled using the IPCC Inventory Software, in compliance with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. The series was updated to consider the period 2010-2012 and additionally, the entire previous series of data from 1990 to 2009 were revised according to the requirements of the IPCC Inventory Software. The same approach was used in the Second Biennial Update Report (SBUR) and the emission trend was expanded by developing the GHG inventory for 2013 and 2014.","Greenhouse gas emissions from the Energy sector are estimated using a detailed sectoral or bottom-up approach. As a way of verifying CO2 emissions from fuel combustion for the time series 2000-2015, South Africa also applied the top-down IPCC reference approach. Most of the emission estimates in the sectoral approach for the Energy sector are calculated using IPCC Tier 1 and 2 methods. Tier 3 methods were used to estimate emissions from Manufacture of solid fuels and other energy industries (1.A.c.), fugitive emissions from the category Venting (1.B.2.a.i) and Other emissions from energy production (1.B.3).","For all other emission sources, default values from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines are used for CO₂ and CH4 emission factors.",Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC). 2006.

According to this approach, key categories are those that, when summed together in descending order of magnitude, add up to 95% of the total level/trend. In other words, a key source category is one that is prioritised within the national inventory system because its estimate has a significant influence on a country's total inventory of direct GHGs, in terms of the absolute emissions and the trend. The level assessment key categories for 2016 are as","In 2017, GHG emissions from IPCC sector Energy amounted to 21,649.43 Gg CO₂ equivalents.

See also Likelihood and Uncertainty.",An assessment of the completeness of the inventory was made for individual activity areas within each source category and the results are presented within the sections covering the individual sectors. The methodology adopted was according to the IPCC 2006 Guidelines (IPCC 2007) with the following notation keys used:,"A Tier I approach (country-specific emission factors) was applied to calculate the emissions from iron and steel production for the different process types in 2017. Default IPCC emission factors were used for the calculation of GHG emissions from basic oxygen furnace, electric furnace and pig iron production, direct reduced iron production and sinter. The separation of energy and process emissions emanating from the use of coke was not done due to a lack of disaggregated information on coke consumption. Hence, energy-related emissions from iron and steel production have been accounted for through the application of default IPCC emission factors.","The methodology used to estimate CO₂ emissions is the Tier 2 method of the IPCC GHG inventory manual, which uses clinker production data and clinker lime content data. As for the estimate of SO₂ emissions from cement production, it was carried out by applying an emission factor excluding combustion to the annual production of cement.","The IPPU category covers the processes that transform materials, chemically or physically to make certain desired products. The energy inputs for process heating are covered under the energy sector section. The IPCC 2006 broadly classifies this sector into seven industrial processes and others as indicated in Annex-C3 (GHG emission from IPPU sector). These are A) Mineral Industry B) Chemical industry C) metal industry D) Non-Energy Products from Fuels and Solvent Use E) Electronics Industry F) Product Uses as Substitutes for Ozone Depleting Substances G) Other Product Manufacture and Use and, H) others. Of these categories, only the mineral products (e.g. cement and lime production) and the Product Uses as Substitutes for Ozone Depleting Substances (Refrigeration and Stationary Air Conditioning And Mobile Air Conditioning) were relevant to Eritrea. Other subcategories (2B-Chemichal industry, 2C-Metal production) were not there in the country within the inventory years. Thus, the whole of CO₂ emission by this sector is attributed to cement industry.

As in the ARS, literature was used to make expert judgements to assess the levels of global warming at which levels of impact and/or risk are undetectable (white), moderate (yellow), high (red) or very high (purple). The colour scheme thus indicates the additional risks due to climate change. The transition from red to purple, introduced for the first time in AR4, is defined by very high risk of severe impacts and the presence of significant irreversibility, or persistence of climate-related hazards combined with a limited ability to adapt due to the nature of the hazard or impact. Comparison of the increase of risk across RFCs indicates the relative sensitivity of RFCs to increases in GMST. As was done previously, this assessment takes autonomous adaptation into account, as well as limits to adaptation (RFC 1, 3, 5) independently of development pathway. The rate and timing of impacts were taken into account in assessing RFC 1 and 5. The levels of risk illustrated reflect the judgements of the Ch 3 authors. RFC1 Unique and threatened systems: ecological and human systems that have restricted geographic ranges constrained by climate related conditions and have high endemism or other distinctive properties. Examples include coral reefs, the Arctic and its indigenous people, mountain glaciers and biodiversity hotspots. RFC2 Extreme weather events: risks/impacts to human health, livelihoods, assets and ecosystems from extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rain, drought and associated wildfires, and coastal flooding. RFC3 Distribution of impacts: risks/impacts that disproportionately affect particular groups due to uneven distribution of physical climate change hazards, exposure or vulnerability. RFC4 Global aggregate impacts: global monetary damage, global scale degradation and loss of ecosystems and biodiversity. RFCS Large-scale singular events: are relatively large, abrupt and sometimes irreversibile changes in systems that are caused by global warming. Examples include disintegration of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. The grey bar represents the range of GMST for the most recent decade: 2006-2015.","The reporting scope of the 2014 China Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry Greenhouse Gas Inventory includes the greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sinks of six land use types including forest land, agricultural land, grassland, wetland, construction land and other land. For each land use and land use change type, the carbon stock changes of the five major carbon pools, namely aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, litter, dead wood and soil organic carbon, were estimated separately according to the actual situation. The level 3 model method was used for the change of soil organic carbon storage in agricultural land, and the “production method” was used for the assessment of forest product carbon storage change. Carbon stock changes are assessed using the Tier 2 method in the IPCC Forestry Good Practice Guidelines, and the wetland methane emissions are assessed using the Tier 1 method, as shown in Table 2-1.","The methodology used to estimate N₂O and CH emissions from manure management is based on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories. The Tier 2 method was used to estimate CH4 emissions attributable to manure management in cattle, while the Tier 1 method was used for other animal species using emission factors per default of the IPCC. With respect to N₂O estimation from manure management, Tier 1 method was used with emission factors and parameters","The uncertainty estimate of the 2017 inventory has been done according to the Tier 1 method presented by the IPCC 2006 GL. Tier 1 method combines the uncertainty in activity rates and emission factors, for each source category and GHG, and then aggregates these uncertainties, for all source categories and GHG-s, to obtain the total uncertainty for the inventory. In many cases uncertainty values have been assigned based on default uncertainty estimates according to IPCC guidelines or expert judgement, because there is a lack of the information. For each source, uncertainties are quantified for emission factors and activity data.","In the waste sector, GHG emissions from treatment and disposal of waste are estimated for solid waste disposal, biological treatment of solid waste, incineration and open burning of waste, wastewater treatment and discharge, and others in accordance with treatment processes. ""Waste"" to be covered in this sector is the waste as defined in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.

The purpose of using these guidelines was to ensure that the GHG emission estimates used the most up to date IPCC GHG Inventory methodology and were transparent, accurate, complete, consistent and comparable (TACCC) through time.","d d t e L The reference approach was also used to estimate CO2 emissions from fuel combustion for the year 2016 and 2017. The GHG Emissions from the energy sector were estimated using reference and sectoral approaches using IPCC Tier 1 analytical framework. Under the reference approach, GHG emissions were estimated using only the fuel consumption data for each type of fuel. The results of estimated CO2 emissions for the GHG inventory year 2016 and 2017 using reference approach has been estimated and compared with the CO2 emissions estimated using sectoral approach. The difference in estimates of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion using the sectoral and reference approaches was within 11%. The reference approach emissions were around 97% from liquid fuel combustion, around 3% from gaseous fuel combustion Table below presents the calculation results using reference and sectoral approach.","For all other emission sources, default values from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines are used for CO₂ and CH4 emission factors.","Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.","The analysis of key categories that contribute the most to the absolute level of national emissions and removals (level assessment) and to the trend of emissions and removals (trend assessment), is conducted using Approach 1 in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.

From 1990 to 2017, emissions from this sector increased by 140%, from 2005 to 2017, emissions from this sector increased by 94%, and from 2016 to 2017, emissions from this sector increased by only 1%. The main increase occurred in the transport sector and by Manufacturing Industries and Construction due to higher consumption of fossil fuels.","Wastewater is derived from a variety of domestic, commercial, and industrial sources and may be treated on-site (uncollected), sewed to a centralized plant (collected), or disposed of untreated nearby or via an outfall. Domestic wastewater is defined as wastewater from household water use, while industrial wastewater is from industrial practices only (IPCC, 2006). Considering that, the methodology is on a per person basis, emissions from commercial wastewater are estimated as part of domestic wastewater. To avoid misunderstanding, the term municipal wastewater was not used in this report. Municipal wastewater is a mixture of household, commercial and non-hazardous industrial wastewater, treated at wastewater treatment plants (IPCC, 2006).","The quality control (QC) procedures are performed by the experts during inventory calculation and compilation. QC measures are aimed at the attainment of the quality objectives. The QC procedures comply with the IPCC good practice guidance and the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.

Quality control checks for the computation of GHG emissions were developed based on the IPCC Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National GHG Inventories to improve the transparency, consistency, comparability, completeness and confidence in the national GHG inventory of emissions estimates. The multi-agency GHG inventory team uses a four-stage inventory preparation process to facilitate continuous improvement to the national GHG inventory for subsequent inventory compilation cycles.","Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and, to a very limited extent, perfluorocarbons (PFCs), have high global warming potentials and are being used as alternatives to different classes of ozone-depleting substances (ODS) that are being phased out under the Montreal Protocol. According to the IPCC 2006 guidelines, HFCs and PFCs are being used in a variety of applications that includes refrigeration and air conditioning, fire suppression and explosion protection, aerosols, solvent cleaning, foam blowing, and other applications such as equipment's sterilization. Rwanda neither produces nor export substitutes for ozone-depleting substances but they are being imported mainly for refrigeration and stationary air conditioning and also the Mobile air conditioning. Other applications, such as aerosols, solvent cleaning, and foam blowing exist in Rwanda; however, there is a lack of inventory data to estimate these sources of emissions.","Present energy conversion technologies rely mainly upon combustion of fossil fuels. During combustion carbon and hydrogen from fossil fuels are converted mainly into carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O), releasing as heat the fuel's chemical energy. This heat is generally either used directly, but more often for generating electricity or for transport. This sector includes two main combustion-related activities, namely stationary combustion and transport. Stationary combustion is responsible for about 70% of greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector.29 Stationary combustion practically includes all energy-consuming activities, except those of the transport sector (in addition to petrochemicals and fertilizers). About half of stationary combustion emissions are associated with combustion in energy industries, essentially power plants and refineries. The energy industry forms a part of this category: energy extraction, production and transformation, which includes power generation and petroleum refineries; manufacturing industries and construction: activities like iron and steel production, chemical manufacturing, paper, food industries, beverages and tobacco, and other sectors such as commerce and residential construction. Mobile combustion devoted to transport (road and other traffic) causes about one quarter of the emissions in the energy sector [IPCC, 2006].","CO₂ emissions from calcination of carbonates are mainly produced in three industrial activities: i) cement production, ii) lime production, and iii) glass production. Other industrial activities with lower significance are the production of ceramics, soda ash and magnesite production. According to this differentiation, IPCC 2006 Guidelines proposes the following categories for estimating CO2 emissions due to calcination of carbonates: 2A1 Cement production, 2A2 Lime production, 2A3 Glass production and 2A4 other uses of carbonates.","Both the current INGEI of Chile (INGEI 1990-2018 or INGEI 4IBA) and the previous one (INGEI 1990-2016 or INGEI 3IBA), which was presented by the country to the United Nations in 2016 as part of its Third Biennial Update Report, are They were prepared following the guidelines of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. For the preparation of this INGEI for Chile, new sources of information have been used in all sectors, together with their respective methodological refinement.

The methodology adopted was according to the IPCC 2006 Guidelines (IPCC 2007) with the following notation keys used:,"Metal production includes the production of metals such as iron and steel. The quantity of iron and steel produced in 2000 was 2.7 and 7.6 kt respectively. Emission factors were the default values recommended by the IPCC 2006. For iron production, default CO2 emission factor from pig iron production was used and as for steel production, CO₂ emission was calculated by electric arc furnace steel making method.","Cement production: The IPCC Good Practice Guidance (2000) presents two methods for estimating CO₂ emissions from cement production: Tier 1. Using data from cement production. Cement production data is used to estimate clinker production (taking into account the types of cement produced: Portland cement, pozzolanic cement, composite cement, blast furnace slag cement, etc.) and including clinker imports and exports (when it is possible). Regarding the Emission Factors, default factors were used: from O-IPCC, 3.1.1.1 p.3.10 (Clinker) and from D-IPCC1996, Reference Manual, 2.3.3.p.2.7 (Cement).","The industrial processes and product use category covers the processes that transform materials, chemically or physically, to make desired products. The energy inputs for process heating are covered under the energy sector section. The IPCC broadly classifies this sector into seven industrial processes, of which three are most relevant to Ethiopia: mineral products (cement and lime production), metal production (iron production/recycling), and other production, including textile, food and beverage production. The main industrial processes considered for estimation of emissions are the cement, lime, glass and iron manufacturing industries. Gases released include CO₂, NMVOC, SO₂, NO, and PFCs. The methodology for calculation of emissions involves multiplication of the activity data by the corresponding emission factors listed in the revised IPCC 1996 guidelines. Figure 3-15 shows the emissions from the IPPU sector in 1994-2013. The cement and metal production industries are growing fast due to the booming construction sector in the country.","Since the 2006 IPCC Guidelines do not present methodology for estimating precursor gases, emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), sulfur dioxide (SO₂) emission factors from the EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook (EEA, 2016) were used.","Sink Any process, activity or mechanism which removes a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas from the atmosphere (UNFCCC Article 1.8 (UNFCCC, 1992)).

2,"This chapter presents a summary of Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory conducted in Rwanda for the period between 2006 and 2015. The inventory was conducted for anthropogenic GHG emissions from four sectors, viz., Energy, Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU), Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use (AFOLU) and Waste. GHG emissions were estimated in compliance with the UNFCCC guidelines for National Communication (NC) from Parties not included in Annex I of the Convention and the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. Tier 1 methodology was mainly used with some country specific data such as physical characteristics of fuels, cement production, etc. Estimation of GHGs was conducted on a gas-by gas basis and estimates of the key sources, sensitivity analysis and uncertainty were provided. In addition, estimates of aggregated GHG emissions and removals expressed in CO2 equivalent are reported. Other, indicators like CO₂/GDP and CO₂/Capita were also estimated and reported. Due to time constraints, only estimates of direct greenhouse gases, i.e., CO2, CH4, N₂O and HFC were considered in this inventory. It is interesting to note that, though, reporting on precursors and indirect emissions is not mandatory for Non Annex I countries, there is a need to consider these gases in future reports of national communication since they are linked with national air pollution management which is a priority for the GoR.","Climate change will increasingly put pressure on food production and access, especially in vulnerable regions, undermining food security and nutrition (high confidence). Increases in frequency, intensity and severity of droughts, floods and heatwaves, and continued sea level rise will increase risks to food security (high confidence) in vulnerable regions from moderate to high between 1.5°C and 2°C global warming level, with no or low levels of adaptation (medium confidence). At 2°C or higher global warming level in the mid-term, food security risks due to climate change will be more severe, leading to malnutrition and micro-nutrient deficiencies, concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Central and South America and Small Islands (high confidence). Global warming will progressively weaken soil health and ecosystem services such as pollination, increase pressure from pests and diseases, and reduce marine animal biomass, undermining food productivity in many regions on land and in the ocean (medium confidence). At 3°C or higher global warming level in the long term, areas exposed to climate-related hazards will expand substantially compared with 2°C or lower global warming level (high confidence), exacerbating regional disparity in food security risks (high confidence).

Annual carbon stock changes in biomass were estimated using the process-based (gain-loss) approach where gains are attributed to growth and losses are due to decay, harvesting, burning, disease, etc. For the land remaining in the same land-use category annual increases in biomass carbon stocks were estimated using Equation 2.9 of the IPCC 2006 Guidelines, where the mean annual biomass growth was estimated using the Tier 1 approach of Equation 2.10 in the IPCC 2006 Guidelines with country specific data. For plantations the Tier 2 approach of this equation was applied. The annual decrease in carbon stocks due to biomass losses were estimated from Equations 2.11 to 2.14 of the IPCC 2006 Guidelines. A Tier 2 approach was implemented for the estimation of carbon biomass stock change in Forest land for both land remaining land and land converted to forest land, while for all the other land classes a Tier 1 for land remaining land and a Tier 2 for land converted to other land (IPCC 2006 Equations 2.15 and 2.16) were applied. The dead organic matter pool only includes litter estimates due to a lack of dead wood data, and it is assumed that all litter pool carbon losses occur entirely in the year of transition (Tier 1). Carbon stock changes in litter were estimated with the stock-difference method (Tier 1), according to Equation 2.23 of the IPCC 2006 Guidelines. Changes in mineral soil carbon stocks for both land remaining land and land converted to a new land use were estimated with a Tier 1 approach from the formulation B of Equation 2.25 (IPCC, 2006 Guidelines, volume 4, p. 2.34). A summary of the methods used are provided in Table 5.3.","Livestock production can result in methane (CH4) emissions from enteric fermentation (IPCC category 3.A.1) and both CH4 and nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions from livestock manure management systems fermentation (IPCC category 3.A.2). Usually, cattle are an important source of CH4 because of their large population and high CH4 emission rate due to their ruminant digestive system, as it is the situation in Mauritius. Methane emissions from manure management tend to be smaller than enteric emissions, with the most substantial emissions associated with confined animal management operations where manure is handled in liquidbased systems. Nitrous oxide emissions from manure management vary significantly between the types of management system used and can also result in indirect emissions due to other forms of nitrogen loss from the system. Manure management category, 3.A.2, only covers the volatilization in the farms, so emissions from animals in pasture are not included in category 3.A.2, but in category 3.C.4. The calculation of the nitrogen loss from manure management systems is also an important step in determining the amount of nitrogen that will ultimately be available in manure applied to managed soils, or used for feed, fuel, or construction purposes, emissions that are calculated 3.C.4 Direct N₂O emissions from managed soils.",The uncertainty of the LULUCF sector activity data comes mainly from the estimation error of the geospatial data. While the uncertainties of the emission factors used come from the default values of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. The uncertainty of the activity data has been included in the uncertainty calculation process and are reported together as uncertainties of emission factors.,"The waste sector releases CO, CH, and N O gases from solid waste disposal, biological treatment of solid waste, incineration, open burning of waste and wastewater treatment and discharge (IPCC, 2006). Solid waste disposal is commonly carried out through land filling, composting, incineration and conversion of waste to energy. The most common GHG produced from Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) disposal in Solid Waste Dumping Sites (SWDSS) is methane. In addition, CO, and NMVOCs as well as small amounts of N O produce in the disposal sites. The primary source of CO₂ from waste is the decomposition of organic matter derived from biomass sources. Based on 2006 IPCC-GL, CO₂ emission from biogenic waste was not considered under the waste sector.","Equation 3.4, page 3.9, Chapter 3, Volume 5, the IPCC 2006 Guidelines; and","According to the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories, the Global Warming Potentials (GWP) provided by the IPCC in its Second Assessment Report (""1995 IPCC GWP Values"") based on the effects of GHGs over a 100-year time horizon was used for expressing GHG emissions and removals in CO₂ equivalents. The values of the GWP of greenhouse gases are shown in the Table below"".","This GHG inventory is prepared using methodology developed in the revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. The UNFCCC software ""Non Annex 1 National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Software"" has been used for the estimation of GHG.","Greenhouse gas emissions from the Energy sector are estimated using a detailed sectoral or bottom-up approach. As a way of verifying CO₂ emissions from fuel combustion for the time series 2000-2017, South Africa also applied the top-down IPCC reference approach. Most of the emission estimates in the sectoral approach for the Energy sector are calculated using IPCC Tier I and 2 methods. Tier 3 methods were used to estimate emissions from Manufacture of solid fuels and other energy","For all other emission sources, default values from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines are used for CO₂ and CH4 emission factors.","IPCC-Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. IPCC Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. Prepared by the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme, 2000.","According to the IPCC definition, a key category is one that is prioritized within the national inventory system because its estimate has a significant influence on a country's total inventory of direct GHGs in terms of the absolute level of emissions, the trend in emissions, or both. Total emissions from the key categories amount to 95% of the total emissions included in the inventory. Key categories for Lebanon are determined with Approach 1 described in Volume 1, Chapter 4 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 4 categories have been identified as key in the analysis, with CO₂ being the main gas and the energy sector being the main key category. Analyses of key categories is performed collectively for all sectors and a list of all key categories is presented in Table 10.","In the period, 1990 to 2017 GHG emissions from the IPCC Sector Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) decreased slightly by 0.9% from 248.13 Gg CO₂ eq in 1990 to 245.78 Gg CO2 eq in 2017. Emissions from the IPCC Sector Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) decreased by 34% from 248.13 Gg CO₂ equivalents in 1990 to 163.84 Gg CO₂ equivalents in 2005. In the period, 2005 to 2017 GHG emissions from the IPCC Sector Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) increased by 50% from 163.84 Gg CO₂ equivalents in 2005 to 245.78 Gg CO₂ equivalents in 2017. The decrease of emissions is mainly caused by production reduction during the Afghan war. The increase of GHG emission are due to the increased production in the chemical industry also due to a significant increase of cement production in the Mineral industry. The use of lubricants in category 2.D Non Energy Products from Fuels and Solvent Use was over the whole period stable. The significant jumps and dips in the last decade are due to fuel shortage, shut down and/or maintenances of the plants.","The CH. emissions from industrial wastewater have been calculated using the IPCC Tier 1 methodology proposed by IPCC 2006. Assessment of CH4 production potential from industrial wastewater streams is based on the concentration of degradable organic matter in the wastewater is chemical oxygen demand (COD), the volume of wastewater, industrial sectors and ways of wastewater treatment. Data on industrial output for industries with the largest potential for wastewater methane emissions identified as follows:","The quality control (QC) procedures are performed by the experts during inventory calculation and compilation. QC measures are aimed at the attainment of the quality objectives. The QC procedures comply with the IPCC good practice guidance and the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. General inventory QC checks include routine checks of the integrity, correctness and completeness of data, identification of errors and deficiencies and documentation and archiving of inventory data and quality control actions.",Emission factors are used by default from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.,"The compilation of the GHG inventory is coordinated by the National Environment Agency (NEA) with data from other agencies and companies. Quality control checks for the computation of GHG emissions were developed based on the IPCC Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National GHG Inventories to improve the transparency, consistency, comparability, completeness and confidence in the national GHG inventory of emissions estimates. The multi-agency GHG inventory team uses a four-stage inventory preparation process to facilitate continuous improvement to the national GHG inventory for subsequent inventory compilation cycles.","Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and, to a very limited extent, perfluorocarbons (PFCs), have high global warming potentials and are being used as alternatives to different classes of ozone-depleting substances (ODS) that are being phased out under the Montreal Protocol. According to the IPCC 2006 guidelines, HFCs and PFCs are being used in a variety of applications that includes refrigeration and air conditioning, fire suppression and explosion protection, aerosols, solvent cleaning, foam blowing, and other applications such as equipment's sterilization.","The energy sector includes all fuel combustion-related emissions from energy industries, manufacturing and construction, transport and other source categories. According to the IPCC Guidelines (2006), emissions originating from energy activities (fossil fuel combustion and fugitive emissions) should be calculated for the sectors and subsectors shown in Table 3-4.","According to 2006 IPCC Guidelines, Vol. 3, Chap. 2.3.1.1, the Tier 1 method is based on applying a default emission factor to national level lime production data. While country-specific information on lime production by type (e.g., high calcium lime, dolomitic lime, or hydraulic lime) is not necessary for good practice in Tier 1, where data are available to identify the specific types of lime produced in the country, this may be used. It is not necessary for good practice to account for LKD in Tier 1.","Both the current INGEI of Chile (INGEI 4IBA, series 1990-2018) and the previous one (INGEI 3IBA, series 1990-2016), which was presented by the country to the United Nations in 2016 as part of its Third Biennial Update Report, were prepared following the guidelines of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. For the preparation of this INGEI of Chile, new sources of information have been used in all sectors, together with their respective methodological refinement. In addition, new country-specific emission factors were developed in the IPPU and Energy sectors and new sources and sinks were incorporated in Waste and LULUCF, which generated differences between the previously reported GHG magnitudes.","Agreement In this Report, the degree of agreement within the scientific body of knowledge on a particular finding is assessed based on multiple lines of evidence (e.g., mechanistic understanding, theory, data, models, expert judgement) and expressed qualitatively (Mastrandrea et al., 2010). See also Confidence, Likelihood, Uncertainty and Evidence.",factors used during the compilation of this inventory. All estimates were made via the use of the IPCC 2006 inventory software.,"The IPCC makes it possible to calculate the emissions from the production of pig iron that is not converted into steel. It is preferable to estimate the emissions from this production separately, since the emission factors for the integrated production of iron and steel (BOF and OHF processes) take into account the emissions from both stages. In the case of Mexico, all the pig iron is converted into steel, so the emissions from this production are already considered in the production of iron and steel (see note of Table 4.1 of IPCC 2006).","GHG emissions from cement production were estimated using a Tier 2 methodology (2006 IPCC Guidelines), based on activity data on clinker production. Data obtained directly from the producer on CaO and MgO ratio in clinker and cement were used for calculating the CO₂ emission factors.","The industrial processes and product use (IPPU) sector accounts for GHG emissions that are related to the raw material used in industrial processes. In El Salvador, according to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, the emitting categories of the IPPU sector are: 2A Mineral industry (cement production, lime production and consumption of","Since the 2006 IPCC Guidelines do not present a methodology for estimating precursor gases, emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds other than methane (NMVOC) ), sulfur dioxide (SO₂) 5 emission factors from the EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook (EEA, 2016) were used.","Source Any process or activity which releases a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas into the atmosphere (UNFCCC Article 1.9 (UNFCCC, 1992)).

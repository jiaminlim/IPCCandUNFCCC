0,0,"Under its sixth assessment cycle, the IPCC released a series of special reports on global warming and its impacts in 2018 and 2019. According to these reports, human activities have been responsible for approximately 1.0°C of global warming since pre-industrial times, and temperature rise is likely to breach 1.5°C between 2030 and 2052 at current rates of warming. More intense and frequent climate and weather extremes have been observed. Warming from historical anthropogenic emissions since the pre-industrial period will continue to drive long-term shifts in the climate system such as sea level rise. According to the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate, under a ""business-as-usual"" (RCP8.5) scenario, global mean sea level rise could increase to 1.1m by 2100, which is 10cm above the most likely estimate from the Fifth Assessment Report released in 2014. This is due to a larger projected ice mass loss from the Antarctica ice sheet.","Models for precipitation and temperature variability however are associated with more uncertainties. Although a decrease in precipitation is being predicted, projected changes in precipitation should be viewed with some caution. The trends analysis implies that total rainy days with 0.1 mm or more of rainfall are decreasing while total yearly days wth 10 mm or more of rain is increasing. This may be interpreted as a decrease in the total amount of precipitation but an increasing trend for convective type rainfall or heavy rainfall. While the uncertainties still prevail, the trends identified from data observations are in line with regional scenarios [255] with regards to both decrease in mean annual precipitation and increase in extreme weather events (increase in the intensity of daily precipitation events) for the Mediterranean region. The IPCC report notes that there will be a higher incidence of drought and heat waves in summer. In this context, while this report will focus on the more certain increase in temperature, as also verified by locally generated scenarios, other impacts associated with the decrease in precipitation and increase in extreme events will be addressed based on regional scenarios.","Models for precipitation and temperature variability however are associated with more uncertainties.

1,1,"Methodologies applied in this national inventory were based on the Revised 1996 IPCC Guideline for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC, 1997) and the uncertainty analysis of the activity data and emission factor was undertaken according to the Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (IPCC, 2003). Forest carbon pools were classified into 6 categories including living above-ground biomasses, living below-ground biomasses, dead wood, litter, soil organic carbon and harvested wood products (IPCC, 1997). Only the fate and amount of aboveground biomass, however, were taken into account. Appropriate methodology tiers, either with or without change of forest land to other land use were chosen according to the Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (IPCC, 2003). Similar to previous reports, Thailand adopted multiple tiers in the national GHG inventory for LULUCF sector in this report. Activity data were obtained from the interpretation of satellite imageries and statistical reports from relevant agencies. Tier 2 emission factors were adopted in most activities using country-specific data from local publications and IPCC defaults were applied as Tier 1 emission factors when appropriate. This was mostly for estimation of non-CO, trace gases emissions. For 5A Changes in Forest and Other Woody Biomass Stocks, the annual increment in biomass, wood density and carbon fraction of dry matter for EFS estimation were obtained from local publications that were reported in the Guideline of the Potential Tree Species Used for Promoting under Clean Development Mechanism by Faculty of Forestry (1997). Reviewing more recent research in regards to large areas and tree samples showed that the average annual biomass increment decreased. Therefore, the EFs used in this study were lower than those used in the previous report. For 5B Forest and Grassland Conversion, the aboveground biomass by forest type before conversion, carbon fraction of dry matter by forest type were obtained from local publications. Fractions of biomass burned on-site and off-site by forest type and fraction of biomass left to decay by forest type were country-specific data, which was obtained from the literature review and expert judgment. For 5C Abandonment of Managed Lands, the supporting data for estimating Tier 2 EFs were the annual rates of aboveground biomass growth for land abandoned in the last twenty years and land abandoned between 20 and 100 years ago classified by forest type. These were country-specific data derived from the literature reviews and expert judgment considered Tier 2.","Annual change in carbon stocks in mineral soils for forest land remaining forest land and land converted to forest land were calculated by applying a Tier I method with Equation 2.25 (IPCC, 2006, Volume 4, p. 2.30). IPCC 2006 default soil carbon reference values were assigned based on the climate and soil type.","In estimating the emissions and removals due to changes in biomass, dead organic matter and soil organic carbon on Forest Land (exclude Land Converted to Forest Land) Liberia applied the Gain-Loss method for Tier 1. The annual change in carbon stocks in biomass was estimated using the gain-loss method, where the annual increase in carbon stocks due to biomass growth and annual decrease in carbon stocks due to biomass losses are estimated. Since there is no available data on land converted to forest land, it is assumed that all managed forest land belongs to the category Forest Land Remaining Forest Land (IPCC, 2007). Emissions data from cropland are currently limited to emissions from cropland remaining cropland and cropland organic soils. Emissions from grassland were from grassland organic soils, and forestland converted to forestland. They are associated with carbon losses from drained histosols under grassland.

The GHG emissions were estimated using either available data from various literature or by using default values provided in the 2006 IPCC guidelines. The current results show a slight growth of emissions in all subcategories mainly due to the increasing population in the same period and changes in the main mode of waste management.","The waste sector covers GHG emissions from treatment and disposal of waste, which are estimated for solid waste disposal (4.A.), biological treatment of solid waste (4.8.), incineration and open burning of waste (4.C.), and wastewater treatment and discharge (4.D.) in accordance with treatment processes suggested in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.","In the waste sector, direct GHG emissions (CH, and N₂O) from solid waste management activities are monitored, including industrial waste (categories 5A ""Solid Waste Disposal"", 5C ""Incineration and Open Burning of Waste"") and waste water treatment (category 5D ""Waste Water Treatment and Discharge""). CO₂ emissions in the waste sector are negligible, but are considered when calculating the aggregated total GHG emissions for this sector.

According to the IPCC Guidelines (2006), emissions originating from energy activities (fossil fuel combustion and fugitive emissions) should be calculated for the sectors and subsectors shown in Table 3-4.","Present energy conversion technologies rely mainly upon combustion of fossil fuels. During combustion carbon and hydrogen from fossil fuels are converted mainly into carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O), releasing as heat the fuel's chemical energy. This heat is generally either used directly, but more often for generating electricity or for transport. This sector includes two main combustion-related activities, namely stationary combustion and transport. Stationary combustion is responsible for about 70% of greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector.29 Stationary combustion practically includes all energy-consuming activities, except those of the transport sector (in addition to petrochemicals and fertilizers). About half of stationary combustion emissions are associated with combustion in energy industries, essentially power plants and refineries. The energy industry forms a part of this category: energy extraction, production and transformation, which includes power generation and petroleum refineries; manufacturing industries and construction: activities like iron and steel production, chemical manufacturing, paper, food industries, beverages and tobacco, and other sectors such as commerce and residential construction.

For this purpose, emissions and removals were considered in absolute value according to the participation that each source of emissions has on the inventory, until 95% of the total was covered. This analysis was performed following the guidelines established in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines (Volume 1, Chapter 4), to determine the level of aggregation of the categories of the Energy, IPPU and Waste sectors. In the case of the AFOLU sector, the recommendation to perform a key category analysis with a higher level of disaggregation was applied, since this sector contains several significant subcategories. In particular, category 3A was divided into 3A1ai-dairy cattle, 3A1aii-beef cattle, and 3A1ab-j- other livestock. Additionally, subcategories 3C4 and 3C5, were also disaggregated by the same type of animal production as category 3A, and into crop residues, synthetic fertilizers and nitrogen mineralization associated with loss of soil organic matter.

While country-specific information on lime production by type (e.g., high calcium lime, dolomitic lime, or hydraulic lime) is not necessary for good practice in Tier 1, where data are available to identify the specific types of lime produced in the country, this may be used. It is not necessary for good practice to account for LKD in Tier 1.","CO₂ is released by heating limestone or calcium carbonate to break down the carbonates, this is usually done in reed kilns or rotary kilns at high temperatures. For the estimation of emissions from the production of lime, the Tier 2 method of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines was applied, based on the data of the national production of lime by type. Country-specific information is required at this level on the proportion of hydrated lime that is produced. The proportions by type of lime with respect to production of lime kiln dust (LKD) at the plant level should be obtained as shown in the following equation.","CO₂ emissions from calcination of carbonates are mainly produced in three industrial activities: i) cement production, ii) lime production, and iii) glass production. Other industrial activities with lower significance are the production of ceramics, soda ash and magnesite production.

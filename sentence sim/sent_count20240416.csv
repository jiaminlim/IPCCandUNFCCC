5,"Note that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in its Article 1, defines climate change as: 'a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods'.",16
6,"Definitions of 'rare' vary, but an extreme weather event would normally be as rare as or rarer than the 10th or 90th percentile of a probability density function estimated from observations.",16
7,"Note that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in its Article 1, defines climate change as: 'a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.",16
8,"Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK and New York, NY, USA.",12
9,"A change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g., by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer.",10
10,Extreme weather event An event that is rare at a particular place and time of year.,9
11,"When a pattern of extreme weather persists for some time, such as a season, it may be classed as an extreme climate event, especially if it yields an average or total that is itself extreme (e.g., drought or heavy rainfall over a season).",8
12,"Note that the Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in its Article 1, defines climate change as: 'a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.'",8
13,"Note that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in its Article 1, defines climate change as: 'a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural dimate variability observed over comparable time periods'.",8
14,"Tier 1 is the basic method, Tier 2 intermediate and Tier 3 most demanding in terms of complexity and data requirements.",8
15,"When a pattern of extreme weather persists for some time, such as a season, it may be classified as an extreme climate event, especially if it yields an average or total that is itself extreme (e.g., high temperature, drought, or heavy rainfall over a season).",8
16,"Exposure The presence of people; livelihoods; species or ecosystems; environmental functions, services, and resources; infrastructure; or economic, social, or cultural assets in places and settings that could be adversely affected.",8
17,"[Note that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in its Article 1, defines climate change as: 'a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.",8
18,"Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings such as modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions and persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use.",7
19,"Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system.",7
20,"In natural systems, the process of adjustment to actual climate and its effects; human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects.",7
21,Vulnerability encompasses a variety of concepts and elements including sensitivity or susceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt.,6
22,"Concentration scenarios, derived from emission scenarios, are often used as input to a climate model to compute climate projections.",6
23,"Climate models are applied as a research tool to study and simulate the climate and for operational purposes, including monthly, seasonal and interannual climate predictions.",6

32,The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between climate change attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric composition and climate variability attributable to natural causes.,6
33,The term encompasses both diffusion of technologies and technological cooperation across and within countries.,6
34,Livelihoods are usually determined by the entitlements and assets to which people have access.,6
35,"Note that scenarios are neither predictions nor forecasts, but are used to provide a view of the implications of developments and actions.",5
36,There is an evolution towards more complex models with interactive chemistry and biology.,5

38,"A plausible representation of the future development of emissions of substances that are radiatively active (e.g., greenhouse gases (GHGs) or aerosols) based on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about driving forces (such as demographic and socio-economic development, technological change, energy and land use) and their key relationships.",4
39,"Adaptation In human systems, the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects, in order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities.",4
40,"When a pattern of extreme weather persists for some time, such as a season, it may be classified as an extreme climate event, especially if it yields an average or total that is itself extreme (e.g., high temperature, drought or heavy rainfall over a season).",4
41,"Adaptation does not prevent all losses and damages, even with effective adaptation and before reaching soft and hard limits.",4
42,"Emission scenario A plausible representation of the future development of emissions of substances that are radiatively active (e.g., greenhouse gases (GHGS), aerosols) based on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about driving forces (such as demographic and socio-economic development, technological change, energy and land use) and their key relationships.",4
43,Two main methods exist: dynamical downscaling and empirical/statistical downscaling.,4
44,"When a pattern of extreme weather persists for some time, such as a season, it may be classified as an extreme climate event, especially if it yields an average or total that is itself extreme (e.g., high temperature, drought, or total rainfall over a season).",4
45,"When a pattern of extreme weather persists for some time, such as a season, it may be classified as an extreme dimate event, especially if it yields an average or total that is itself extreme (e.g., high temperature, drought, or heavy rainfall over a season).",4
46,"In all cases, the quality of the driving model remains an important limitation on quality of the downscaled information.",4
47,"Definitions of 'rare' vary, but an extreme weather event would normally be as rare as, or rarer than, the 10th or 90th percentile of a probability density function estimated from observations.",4

54,"The dynamical method uses the output of regional climate models, global models with variable spatial resolution, or high-resolution global models.",4
55,"Definitions of 'rare' vary, but an extreme event would normally be as rare as or rarer than the 10th or 90th percentile of a probability density function estimated from observations.",4
56,The empirical/statistical methods are based on observations and develop statistical relationships that link the large-scale atmospheric variables with local/regional climate variables.,4

Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings such as modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions and persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use.

Key categories were identified using a predetermined cumulative emissions threshold and were those that, when summed together in descending order of magnitude, add up to 95% of the total level. Given Kuwait's circumstances as a major oil producing and exporting country which leads to uniformity of emissions in Kuwait over the years (energy sector was always the leading sector in economy and therefore in GHG emissions), the analysis was limited to level assessment excluding trend assessment. Analysis was also limited to CO2 since the latter represents 97.2% of total GHG emissions. Table 2-10 summarizes the results of key category analysis.</td>\n",

       "227  The analysis was performed using Approach 1 recommended in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Vol.4 Ch.4. Key categories were identified using a predetermined cumulative emissions threshold and were those that, when summed together in descending order of magnitude, add up to 95% of the total level. Given Kuwait's circumstances as a major oil producing and exporting country which leads to uniformity of emissions in Kuwait over the years (energy sector was always the leading sector in economy and therefore in GHG emissions), the analysis was limited to level assessment excluding trend assessment. Analysis was also limited to CO2 since the latter represents 97.2% of total GHG emissions. Table 2-10 summarizes the results of key category analysis.   \n",
